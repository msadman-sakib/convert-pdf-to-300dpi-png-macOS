This bash script just converts all the pdf files saved in a directory into 300dpi png files, which are easy to render in powerpoint presentation.

##Use case:
I use it to generate all my pdfs images generated from R scripts into png. As, pdfs are used to make main figures in illustrator and pngs are used for powerpoint presentation
