This bash script just converts all the pdf files saved in a directory into 300dpi png files, which are easy to render in powerpoint presentation.

## Usage case:
I use it to convert all my pdfs images generated from my R scripts into png. I mostly use pdfs to make main figures in illustrator(also have the opportunities to manually modify if necessary) and pngs for powerpoint presentation.

### Requirements
- Install homebrew for macOS (`$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`)
- Use brew to install imagemagick in macOS (`$ brew install imagemagick`)

[Get it from here]: https://brew.sh/
